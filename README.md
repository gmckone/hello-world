# hello-world

I'm rusty. thats an understatement.
I used to code.
I learned a lot
did web dev, did SQL. felt like the world was my oyster but gradually work became more about people and paper and less about code.
So I'm seeking to recapture that feeling of power and accomplishment and effectiveness by restarting some coding, learning some more and contributing.
